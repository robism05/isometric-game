Hello all,

I have been learning C for ~1 month now and I wanted to test me skills.
My code is a burning garbage dumbster fire. It sucks. 

I tried to plan in out into sepearate files but I would always forget where each thing needed to
go and how to call in this file without it colliding with other files. Blah blah blah.

I am new to C, and game development (even though this isn't even a game), 
but hopefully, thorugh trial and error, I can only get better from here on out.

* Arrow keys to move vertically/horizontally
* WASD to move diagonally along the grid
* triple space bar in a row to jump
