lets write some random bs here


Idea 1
- terra nil and outlanders 
- you have to collect resources to make devices/electroics and you make money
- but the more you excavate and mine, the weaker the planet gets
- you can either develop technological solutions to save the planet or you can simply replant and regrow
- if the planet dies (also add cool explosion scene) it is game over
- but the goal is to make money while keeping the planet healthy and alive.

Idea 2
- you are greta thunberg and you beat up corrupt politicians
- facts and logic come out of every punch and kick

Idea 3
- like a card game
- basically..


The Story Board
=================
We start off in a factory. A help screen pops up and shows us the controls (how to move around, jump, etc)
Then the help menu fades out and the music fades in. The story begins.

Inside the factory you can see the moving pieces and assembly happening. A pop up box tells you they
are manufacturing electric cars
